# Enigma Machine Simulation
This project is a simulation of the Enigma machine used by the Nazis during World War II. The Enigma machine was a complex encryption device that played a significant role in the war. This simulation allows users to configure the Enigma machine in the same way the Nazis did, using real rotors and reflectors according to historical documentation.
